# A Simple Hangman Game in Python Language.
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.7+-blue.svg)

Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words. You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find. Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels)
